# Initiation Phase

## Project Description
Codebreaker, more commonly known as `Mastermind`, is a `two-player game`, where one person creates and hides a combination consisting of `four-colour pegs` chosen from `six different colours` (Green, Red, Blue, Yellow, Orange and Pink). The `other player tries to guess the combination` within 12 turns and receives `two types of clues` after each guess. If one of the pins that player guesses are in the correct position and is the correct colour, player one will put a black pin. If only the colour is correct, the player will put a white pin. However, if none of the guesses are correct, then no pins will be outputted. The project is to be completed by three tenth-grade programmers from Mr.Anandaraja's ICS4U class: Peter, James and Lakshy. 

## Scope of Project
The scope of this project is to `create Mastermind using Java GUI and Javafx`. The software will have `two game modes`, player against computer and computer against the player. Our program will be able to guess the user set pin within a max of `6 moves`, a minimum of `4 moves` and an average of `4.5 moves`. The player can choose from `three different difficulties: easy, medium, hard`. For each difficulty, the computer will utilize a `different algorithm` to guess the user's pattern. If stuck, the user can press a button to receive a `hint`. Our software contains a `colour wheel` to choose colours if the user happens to be colour blind. There will be `peaceful music` playing in the background to provide a serene gaming environment.
